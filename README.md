## Description

_{The homepage has links to multiple projects that I have created.  This portfolio is fully responsive, but best viewed on a desktop computer in order to get full functionality. On a desktop, a hover will create a dropdown transition with the links. On tablet or mobile, the links are visible automatically.  There is an "about" page with information about myself, and a contact page where I can be reached with links to my email and phone.}_
